Begin the morning by saying to yourself: "I shall meet with the busy-body, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial." All these things happen to them because of their ignorance of what is good and evil. But I who have seen that the nature of the good is beautiful, and the bad is ugly, and that the nature of he who does wrong is akin to me, not only of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in the same intelligence and the same portion of divinity, I can neither be injured by any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly, nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him. For we are made for cooperation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth. To act against one another then is contrary to nature, and it is acting against one another to become frustrated and to turn away.
